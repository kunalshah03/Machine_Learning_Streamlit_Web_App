# Machine_Learning_Streamlit_Web_App
Edibility based Classification System based on 22 attributes regarding the mushrooms available globally.
Built a web application to classify the type of mushroom to be edible or poisonous. 
The app allows the user to choose between the classifiers and to tune in the hyperparameters. 
Users can also visualize the results based on the metrics selected.

 Accuracy obtained ( With regularization parameter = 0.01):
 SVM - 0.95 (Using a linear kernel)
 Logistic Regression - 0.92 (Number of iterations = 500)
Random forest - 0.99 (Depth = 5)

Libraries used: Streamlit, sklearn, pandas, NumPy.
